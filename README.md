Since I am an rc-plane enthusiast and want to explore and learn about the desinging of an aircraft, I had issuses finding the right path for learning. My goal is to build a website with all the
basic information of an aircraft and calculations related to it.
So this is just a start using C program to find the flight time of an aircraft since i know  c programm.

Comming to the code we have a basic equation which calcuates the flight time by knowing the motor amps consumption and the capacity of a lipo battery, these are the 2 inputs that is required for 
my calculator. The output of the code will be given in the format of:
The estimated flight time is %d minutes and %d seconds.
%d represent the final values of the equation.

//Ignore this line, this line is for me to learn about git hub (cuz i am learning to pull)
